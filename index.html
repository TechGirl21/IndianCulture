          <h1 id="heading"><strong><em>Indian cuisine</em></strong></h1>
        <h3>
          <p><em>
              Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
Indian food, not unlike any other country’s national food scene, is a vast constellation of culinary influences and traditions from all over the Asian continent.

<h3>
<p>
  Being the foodie country that India is, there’s a meal planned around every time of the day and food available in every corner. Appetizers served in Indian restaurants are typically popular Indian street foods.

</p>
</h3>

  <ul>
   <li><strong>Bhajji</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m6GAX-kfNc">Bhajji (or Pakoras)</a> are crispy deep fried dollops of spicy chickpea batter served with spicy condiments called chutney. Onion bhajji features thinly sliced onions that have been added to the chickpea batter and then deep fried to crispy perfection.   </li>
    <br>
   <li><strong>Samosa</strong>: Another popular Indian street food is the samosa. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKPAfUCn_Jo">Samosas</a> contain a small amount of spicy potato or meat filling  that are then wrapped in dough and deep fried until crispy and flaky.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Vada Pav</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01ujzzzeTqU">Vadas</a> are deep fried dumplings or flattened patties of potato, and a pav is a plain old dinner roll. Vada pav is essentially a spicier vegetarian version of sliders where the dumpling or patty is sandwiched between two halves of a dinner roll. Oftentimes, condiments are added to the mix (often a green mint and cilantro chutney).</li>
  </ul>


<h2> <strong><em>Indian Breads</em></strong></h2>
<img src="https://sukhis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IndianBread.jpg" alt="Indian Breads">
<h3><p> Breads in India are mostly flatbreads. It’s the way they are cooked or the type of flour used to make them that determines what they are called.
</p>
</h3>
  <ul>

  <li><strong>Naan</strong>: Naan is one of the most popular Indian flatbreads. To make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA_3gY9rX4Y">Naan</a>, wheat flour dough is prepared either by allowing it to rise using yeast, or by the addition of yogurt to the dough. That dough is then rolled into flatbreads and cooked in an Indian oven, called a tandoor.</li>
  <br />
  <li><strong>Roti</strong>: Naan is popular on Indian restaurant menus, but roti is a staple in Indian homes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-YhV1gmoo8">Roti</a> is a no fuss Indian bread, typically made with whole wheat flour that’s kneaded into a soft dough, then rolled into thin circles and cooked on a tava (Indian skillet) on the stovetop.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Paratha</strong>: Paratha is a flatbread that is layered and pan fried. They are made with wheat flour, and ghee or oil is smeared between layers of dough while rolling them. But there are many ways in which you can make a paratha, specially stuffed paratha. A Stuffed Paratha is when filling is stuffed into a ball of dough and then rolled into a flatbread.</li>
